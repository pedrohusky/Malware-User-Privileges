# Malware-User-Privileges
A malware written in python that has plenty of functions. 
When installed, it copies itself to another folder, adds a registry to be run every reboot with user privileges. 
Then, almost all possibilities are unlocked if you run master_server.py in your machine. 
If everything works, you should see a Agent: XXX.XXX.XXX

I will not explain in details, anyone who wants to try it, go ahead:
 - you should generate the exe with the generate_exe
 - this exe should be executed in the TARGET machine
 - after executing the exe, nothing happens, but the machine will be infected with the Agent that will be running in background with every reboot of the machine.
 - After knowing that the machine is infected (or not), you can open the master_server. It will open a GUI that shows ANY active agents, with the possibility of selecting them.
 - When selecting a agent, the options on the bottom will enable. They are self-explanatory.

PS: The malware is in SAFE-MODE. That means, it cannot encrypt/decrypt data from the TARGET machine.
- This can only execute cmd-commands that are harmful to the machine. If you want to disable SAFE_MODE, you can study it.

The program also has a obfuscation file that can be used freely if you want to. This obfuscates the file code, while mantaining functionability.
